// Write a Person class with an instance variable, 'age', and a constructor that takes an integer, 'initialAge', as a parameter.
    // The constructor must assign 'initialAge' to 'age' after confirming the argument passed as 'initialAge' is not negative;
    // if a negative argument is passed as 'initialAge', the constructor should set 'age' to 0 and print 'Age is not valid, setting age to 0.'.
    
// In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
    // 1. yearPasses() should increase the 'age' instance variable by 1.
    // 2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
        // If 'age < 13', print 'You are young.'.
        // If 'age >= 13' and 'age < 18', print 'You are a teenager.'.
        // Otherwise, print 'You are old.'.

// To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you,
    // but you'll be writing everything in the future.
    // The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method.
    // Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!

function Person(initialAge){
    // Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge
    // methods check for variable 'age' so can initialize it equal to initialAge and change accordingly
    let age = initialAge
    // check for negative initialAge
    if (initialAge < 0) {
        age = 0;
        console.log('Age is not valid, setting age to 0.');
    }
  this.amIOld=function(){
   // fulfilling all the if checks
    if (age < 13) {
        console.log('You are young.');
    } else if (age >= 13 && age < 18) {
        console.log('You are a teenager.');
    } else {
        console.log('You are old.')
    }
  };
   this.yearPasses=function(){
          // Increment the age of the person in here
          age++;
